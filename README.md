# Gains.farm NFT Bot
Bot that executes limit orders on Gains.farm, the decentralized leverage trading platform on Polygon.

## Preparation

1. We recommend creating a specific address/wallet, otherwise it might create problems if you use the address the bot uses while it's running (nonce errors).

-> You can send all your NFTs to this new wallet using the block explorer, using the "transferFrom" function.

2. Your wallet needs to hold a small amount of the Wrapped ERC677 LINK token

Because the "normal" LINK token on Polygon is an ERC20, and oracles only support the ERC677 version, you will need to convert your LINK tokens here: https://pegswap.chain.link/

Each request to trigger an order will cost 0.008 LINK (to pay our node operators for our real-time feed).
